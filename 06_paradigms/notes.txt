Print statements for Scheme, NetLogo, and Python:
Scheme: 
print "hello world"

NLogo:
write "hello world"

Python:
print("hello world")

The three languages are similar since they all use two components: the print statement, and the string that is being printed.
The string is in quotations all three times, because this indicates that the characters are in string form, and not anything else.

For NetLogo, the print statement is a bit different, because it's not called print, but instead it's called write. 
This could be because there really isn't too much of a point in using NetLogo to display data in the form of words, since I think it's mostly a visual language, with most of the code probably referring to the visual elements of the language.
Also, the thing called print probably does something similar, but still different.

Compared to java, all three of these languages are very easy, since we only have to type 3 short words for a print statement.
In java, we have to do System.out.println("string"), which is a lot longer, and looks a lot more complicated.
Not only that, but for java, we have to define the method, as well as the class, so that adds on the work we have to do to execute a simple print statement.

DISCO
0. Math.random() is capable of producing a random double within the range of [0,1). 
1. Using this means that the object is referring to itself. It is used to clarify what object a method or variable belongs to.
2. By supplying an instance of a class as an argument in a method, you are able to access its instance variables, private or not.  
QCC
0. If you overwrite a method, such as toString(), is there a way to still use the original method associated with the method name that is overwritten?
1. What is the difference between null and an empty String?

/***
    driver for class Coin
    ~~~ SUGGESTED WORKFLOW: ~~~
    1. Compile this file and run. Note anything notable.
    2. Move the "TOP" line down, so that it is below the first statement.
    (emacs: with cursor at beginning of TOP line, C-k C-k, DOWN, DOWN, C-y)
    (your editor: ???)
    3. Compile and run again.
    4. Resolve errors one at a time until it works.
    5. Repeat 2-4 until TOP meets BOTTOM.

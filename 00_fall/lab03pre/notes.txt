DISCO:
Print statements are much slower than mathematical operations in Java.
When testing out the currentTimeMillis() method, we found out that it was kind of inaccurate.
Each operating system measures time differently, and the smallest amount of time actually measured is probably bigger than 1ms.
When we tested it out, we made a for loop that iterated 50000 times, and it only took 0-1ms, but when we used a different method,
nanoTime(), this put the actual time at 4.25-4.35ms.

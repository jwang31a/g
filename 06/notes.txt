Scheme:
print "Hello world"

NetLogo:
write "Hello world"

Python:
print("Hello world")

All of these are fairly simple, consisting of two parts: the print statement and the string that is being printed.
The string is always in double quotations to indicate that it is a string.
The print statement is only one word, "print".

NetLogo is a bit different, as instead of a print statement, it uses a write statement. I think this could be because of something to do with the use of the language, since NetLogo seems to be more of a visual language, using the grid of patches more than math.
It might also be because the print statement does something similar, but not the exact same in NetLogo.

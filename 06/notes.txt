Scheme:
print "Hello world"

NetLogo:
write "Hello world"

Python:
print("Hello world")

All of these are fairly simple, consisting of two parts: the print statement and the string that is being printed.
The string is always in double quotations to indicate that it is a string.
The print statement is only one word, "print".

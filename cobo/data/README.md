Activity 1

1. Google, Facebook

2. payments, device

3. delimited: "having the limits or boundaries established"
    necessary when talking about data files b/c need to be aware of the "limits" of the data in the file

4. try to parse integers? look for commonalities across data in different rows?

5. health, sorts

6. How can we live longer? What is the best way to shoot a basketball?

7. Kaggle, searched for "basketball" : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball

8. First data set has 22 notebooks.
    Second data set has 23 notebooks.
    One benefit of using a larger data set with more records is that there is more data to work with and therefore a bigger portion of the total area we're interested in is represented.

9. Captured user data about watch time can be used to improve service by recommending videos similar to those with longer watch time. Outside of the service or wesbite, this data can positively improve content creators' awareness of how their media affects others.

10. The data was scraped from a website and cleaned up.

11. Perhaps there are situations where the benefit provided is worth the risk to personal privacy, if a user is really interested in getting to know more about themselves and receive recommendations. A user may also feel that the information they are providing is not particularly valuable to them.

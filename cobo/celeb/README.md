## Q
* As long as a clue doesn't mention the celebrity's name, it's valid?
* Is there a length limit on a clue?
* ~~How will we make the game have a reader and a guesser? Pass and play?~~
  * The "reader" will input a celebrity using a constructor with both the name and the clue at the beginning, then the guesser will play the game.

## CC
* A "hat" object isn't necessarily needed since the hat could just be an array(list).

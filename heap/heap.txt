Heaps are rooted trees satisfying heap property.
We will be using binary minheaps, where the root is the minimum, has two children that are greater than it.

Q: How remove?
A: If no children, point to null.
A: If one child, promote child.
Q: What if two children, which child to promote, how promote?

Q: How add?
A: There can sometimes be two (or more?) places to add a new element to.
A: How add element smaller than root, how do?

Hint: simplest solution?
Which side we add to is irrelevant and adds complexity?
